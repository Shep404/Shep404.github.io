# Self-Assessment

Everyone will say that they accomplished a lot while they were attending college. They will say that "Hey, look at all the pretty code I created. Look at me." While this may fine for most students, not many can say that they did this to challenge themselves. To pick the degree in which they knew the least about beforehand to see what their limits are to learning. This was my degree path. I had never seen a single line of code before I started this degree and knew even less about how computers functioned. Before this degree, I only took jobs that required a lot of physical demand on the body. Not much in intelligence. This became boring and I decided to utilize my VA benefits to get a degree and to challenge myself along the way. Fast forward to present day and I finished this degree with a 3.9 GPA and completely baffled even myself. I knew beforehand that I had a strong pantient for picking up new skills, but this even amazed me with the success of this experiment.

Below are three "artifacts" that I created to showcase what I accomplished while I studied at Southern New Hampshire University. These three are in three separate categories: Software Design (Artifact 1), Data Structure (Artifact 2), and lastly Databases. In this last class, we were instructed to choose an artifact from one of our previous courses and modify it to showcase that we indeed did learn how to engineer software even at the drop of a hat. I decided to modify mine in such a way that will showcase my outside perspective rather than intelligence. To find flaws that I noticed about the scenario that we were working with and fix it for any future employers. I hope you enjoy.

# Artifact 1

**BEFORE**


This artifact was created earlier this year. This project was intended to teach us embedded programming utilizing a Texas Instruments board to make a working thermostat.

I selected this item, because of all the projects that I created, this one was one of the most challenging for me. It is one thing to make a program do something you want, but for me, it was even more challenging to work with preset configurations and working with timers. In the end, I worked it out, and managed to make a working thermostat. I improved this project by looking into HOW the thermostat was going to operate in a “real world” scenario and saw an opportunity to increase the efficiency of the furnace it would be operating. The objective was to delay the heating code to activate when the if else loop would trigger the event. If I did this, it would be longer in between the furnace activating and deactivating, alleviating some of the strain turning on and off this piece of equipment. This in turn would mean fewer times the furnace would need repairs in its lifetime.

After I made this small change, I met the objective for the enhancement that I had planned. Any more changes to this code, in relation to efficacy, would require more knowledge of furnaces. This would entail average time to come up to output heat, how long it would take to dissipate the heat, and any other concerns that could be raised over the functionality of the pieces of equipment used.

All in all, I was reminded of the coding standard “keep it simple stupid” while making this enhancement and while making this project in general. I didn’t need anything too fancy to get the job done. All I needed was to keep things simple, so no misunderstandings happened between the program and myself. Other than trying to keep things simple, there were no challenges faced.

**AFTER**


# Artifact 2

**BEFORE**


This artifact was created earlier this year. This project was intended to teach us NoSQL queries and to export them to an HTML interface that the user could use.

I selected this item, because of all the projects that I created, this one was the most fun for me. It let me put all my programing skills that I learned since my arrival at Southern New Hampshire University to use. It also allowed me to combine a few of my classes to show me that I could make real world changes. The objective that I wanted to make in this project was to add more functionality to the queries. To build on the structure that I had already made. This would allow the user more freedom to do searches. The enhancement that I decided was to introduce emotional support cats. Since the early 2000’s, we have seen a decline in the number of visitors to national parks and other such activities. This leads to more people being in less physically active activities.

After I made this small change, I met the objective for the enhancement that I had planned. Any more changes to this code, in relation to breed and age, would require more knowledge of what people are looking for. This would entail leaning the temperament of all the breeds, climate of the client, and what the client would need them to do outside of their supporting roles.

All in all, I was reminded of the coding standard “keep it simple stupid” while making this enhancement and while making this project in general. I didn’t need anything too fancy to get the job done. All I needed was to keep things simple, so no misunderstandings happened between the program and myself. Other than trying to keep things simple, there were no challenges faced.

# Artifact 3

**BEFORE**

![artifact](images/artifact3.jpg)

This artifact was created during the summer of 2021. This project was intended to teach us SQL queries and to construct a database from that to make searches easier.

I selected this item, because this was the first project that I left thinking that I could handle anything else the degree could throw at me. I knew the material quite well, I preformed all tasks easily, and I didn’t have to refresh my memory on any of the material when I constructed the final project. The objective that I wanted to make in this project was to add more functionality to the queries. To build on to the structure that I had already made. The enhancement was aimed at a flaw that I saw when entering the data to recognize the customer. There could be confusion if you didn’t know every single entry.

After some deliberation with myself, I decided on cannibalizing a file I made for another class and using all the aspects of that file. This file was intended to use CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) in another database. I altered it enough to be compatible with the new database. Any more changes to this code would entail more insight into the company to determine if there are any more flaws in their system of collection.

All in all, I was reminded of the coding standard “keep it simple stupid” while making this enhancement and while making this project in general. I didn’t need anything too fancy to get the job done. All I needed was to keep things simple, so no misunderstandings happened between the program and myself. Other than trying to keep things simple, there were no challenges faced.
